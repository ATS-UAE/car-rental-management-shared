# Bookings

Users of the application can manage bookigns through the "Bookings" page.

## Creating Bookings

Only guests can [create](permissions.md#bookings) bookings.

Vehicles will only be available if:

- The *guest* has the includes category of the vehicle.
- No pending, or on-going booking is on the vehicle.

## Approving Bookings

After a *guest* has sent a booking request, the *KEY MANAGER* or *ADMIN* can approve or deny the request.

Once a booking has been approved, an email will be sent to the *guest* containing the location of the vehicle, and the pick-up date.

You can also change the booking time, or vehicle if so desired.

## Finalizing Bookings

Once a booking has been approved and completed, you can finalize it. You can change the actual start and end time of the booking, and how much the guest will be charged.
