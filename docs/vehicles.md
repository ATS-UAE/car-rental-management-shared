### Vehicle Categories

When creating or updating a vehicle, you can optionally select which categories it belongs to. When a category is specified, *guest* accounts can only book vehicles which includes that category. See [User Categories](/users.md#User-Categories)

### Wialon unit

When creating or updating a vehicle, you can optionally bind it to a wialon unit. Once it is bound, the live location of the vehicle can be seen by the customers when they are booking the vehicle.

### Booking charge estimate

When creating or updating a vehicle, you can optionally specify how much the cost is calculated. This cost is shown to the *guest* when they are booking a vehicle.

## Defleeting a vehicle

Defleeting a vehicle removes it from the list of available vehicle when a *guest* is booking.

You can defleet a vehicle by clicking the block icon ![Defleet](/media/icons/block-24px.svg)
